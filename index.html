        <p>during this day everyone in this house hold had to be quite or speak in spanish.(everyone exept the adults) the one person who did not like this idea went along with it anyway the two who planned it did not really do it and had to do a lot of pushups. for that was the punishment for speaking in english. the two who wanted to do it had to do push ups many times. while the other one who disliked the idea did about half of that.</p>
